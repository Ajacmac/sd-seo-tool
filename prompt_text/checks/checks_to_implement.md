Purpose:
To make complicated content easier to read and understand, while keeping the important details and meaning intact.

   - Make sure you understand the main ideas and key points

 Identify Complex Parts
   - Look for:
      Long, winding sentences
      Jargon or technical terms
      Overly formal language
      Nested or complicated ideas

 Simplify Language
   - Use shorter, more common words where possible
   - Break up long sentences into smaller ones
   - Explain technical terms if you need to use them

 Reorganize Ideas
   - Put the main point at the start of paragraphs
   - Use bullet points or numbered lists for multiple ideas
   - Make sure ideas flow logically from one to the next

 Add Clarity
   - Use examples to explain difficult concepts
   - Add transitions between ideas to show how they connect
   - Use active voice more often than passive voice

 Keep it Balanced
   - Don't remove all complex terms if they're needed
   - Make sure you don't lose important details or nuances

   - Check that it still conveys all the important information
   - Make sure it's not too simple for the intended audience

Output:
- Provide the simplified version of the text
- If asked, explain your main simplification choices

Original: "The implementation of the new regulatory framework necessitates a comprehensive review of existing operational procedures to ensure compliance and mitigate potential risks associated with non-adherence."

Simplified: "We need to carefully check our current work methods. This will help us follow the new rules and avoid problems that could happen if we don't."

Remember: The goal is to make the content clearer and more accessible, not to dumb it down. Keep the core message and important details, just present them in a more straightforward way.
